# AutomatedDiscovery

## Description
Automated Discovery of Personal Data in an Unknown Relational Database with GDPR Compliance

## Objectives:

- **Automated Personal Data Discovery:** The primary objective of this concept is to develop an automated tool that can accurately and efficiently identify personal data in an unknown relational database. The system should be capable of handling large-scale databases with diverse data types and structures.

- **GDPR Compliance:** Ensuring GDPR compliance is paramount. The solution will be designed to align with GDPR principles, including data minimization, lawful processing, and the rights of data subjects. It should support the "right to be forgotten," data access requests, and consent management.

- **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** To maintain data privacy and security during the discovery process, the system will incorporate advanced privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy and anonymization. These methods will help protect the identities of individuals while still providing valuable insights for the database owner.

## Features and Functionality:

- **Schema Analysis:** The system will analyze the database schema to understand the data types and relationships between tables, which is crucial for identifying personal data fields accurately.

- **Pattern Recognition:** Utilizing machine learning and natural language processing algorithms, the system will identify patterns and context within the data to determine potential personal data attributes, such as names, addresses, email addresses, and other identifiers.

- **Data Classification:** The discovered data will be classified into different categories based on GDPR requirements, distinguishing personal data, sensitive data, and non-personal data.

- **Privacy Preservation:** The system will employ cryptographic techniques like tokenization or encryption to protect sensitive personal data during the discovery process, ensuring GDPR compliance.

- **Data Subject Identification:** The system will be capable of identifying and associating personal data with specific data subjects, enabling efficient responses to data subject requests.

- **Consent Management:** The solution will integrate consent management features to track and manage user consent for processing personal data, making it easier for organizations to adhere to GDPR consent requirements.

- **Data Access Controls:** Access controls will be implemented to limit access to personal data based on the principle of "need-to-know."

- **Data Visualization and Reporting:** The system will provide intuitive data visualization and reporting capabilities to help organizations understand the distribution of personal data within their databases and assess GDPR compliance.
